# Button

Buttons define what action will occur when the user interacts with features and components of the platform. Buttons are used to initialize and dictate the actions on the interface, either in the background or foreground of an experience.

## primary buttons

Primary buttons are medium sized and have a colored background. They aren't always the same color, though, so there isn't a default "primary" look or CSS class - primary here is more of a concept.

Please note that color and size are built through CSS classes applied to the `<button>` element. You'll always need to specify color and size to get a complete button.

Use these for the main action in a section or screen. You should display only one primary button at a time.

Mouseover and click to view :hover and :active states.

```.jsx
<Button>Button</Button>
